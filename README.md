# The Diversity of Natural Number Models and the Model-Dependence of Infinite Interpretation

## Abstract
This paper presents the construction of an extended natural number model, \( N^+ \), based on the Axiom of Choice (AC), which fully satisfies the Peano axioms. Despite its compliance with the formal properties of natural numbers, \( N^+ \) admits a surjection onto the powerset of the standard naturals \( \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \), thereby collapsing the classical infinite hierarchy. This result demonstrates that the notion of "natural number" is not uniquely determined by the Peano axioms, and that the structure of infinity is model-dependent within ZFC.
